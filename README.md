# Box Generator

The assignment was to create a form component that accepts a color. When the form is submitted, a box is added to an array of boxes that is the color submitted in the form. The boxes need to appear immediately when submitted and they must lie next to eachother and wrap if necessary.
The only components that are in use for this assignment are the App.js and the BoxForm.js.
